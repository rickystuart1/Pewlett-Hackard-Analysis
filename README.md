# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to run a database analysis for the company Pewlett Hackard. They are aware that a large number of employees would be nearing retirement age and wanted more insight on who was ready to retire, so they could prepare for the change. We needed to determine the number of employees that are eligible to retire, see which department they are a part of and to figure out which senior level employees are nearing retirement. The eployees nearing retirement would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program for new hires.

## Results

## Summary

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

There is a potential of 72,458 roles that need to be replaces within the next four years.  

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There are only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. If every employee that is eligible were to retire at once and the company were to find a replacement for each person, the mentorship eligible employees would each have to mentor 46-47 new hires. So I do not believe there are enough mentors and the company is not prepared.

*The following queries were used to calulate the totals.*
