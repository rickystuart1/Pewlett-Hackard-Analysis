The purpose of this project was to run a database analysis for the company Pewlett Hackard. They are aware that a large number of employees would be nearing retirement age and wanted more insight on who was ready to retire, so they could prepare for the change. We needed to determine the number of employees that are eligible to retire, see which department they are a part of and to figure out which senior level employees are nearing retirement. The eployees nearing retirement would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program for new hires.
